# Cocktail-archive
I'm preparing a cocktail database using **SQLite** for a mobile app, which I'll use as a reference guide in the preperation of drinks, one of my hobbies.

I'm using db_creation.py merely to get a grasp on **SQLite** and the **sqlite3** library while inserting the data into the DB.
Now the DB's got a few drinks in it, so I built a simple prototype in python with the main functionalities before getting to the actual app.

Objectives of the project:
* getting pratical with **SQLite** on Python
* having an easy-to-use recipe collection of cocktail
* getting a first grasp on mobile development on Android Studio in Kotlin

App features:
* cocktail database
* drink search by name, by liquor or by time of the day
* full recipe will be displayd

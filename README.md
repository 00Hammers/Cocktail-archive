# Cocktail-archive
I'm preparing a little (for the moment) cocktail database using **SQLite** for a mobile app, which I'll use as a reference guide in the preperation of drinks, one of my hobbies.

I'm using db_create.py merely to get a grasp on **SQLite** and the **sqlite3** library.
When the DB's got a few drinks in it, I'll build a simple prototype in python with the main functionalities before getting to the actual app.

Objectives of the project:
* getting pratical with **SQLite** with Python
* having an easy recipe collection of cocktail
* trying mobile development
